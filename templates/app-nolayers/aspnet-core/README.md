# MyCompanyName.MyProjectName

## About this solution

This is a minimalist, non-layered startup solution with the SS Framework. All the fundamental SS modules are already installed. 

### Pre-requirements

* [.NET 8.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
* [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Configurations

The solution comes with a default configuration that works out of the box. However, you may consider to change the following configuration before running your solution:

* Check the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json` files under the `MyCompanyName.MyProjectName` project and change it if you need.

### Before running the application

#### Generating a Signing Certificate

In the production environment, you need to use a production signing certificate. SS Framework sets up signing and encryption certificates in your application and expects an `openiddict.pfx` file in your application.

This certificate is already generated by SS CLI, so most of the time you don't need to generate it yourself. However, if you need to generate a certificate, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -v -ep openiddict.pfx -p 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

> `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` is the password of the certificate, you can change it to any password you want.

It is recommended to use **two** RSA certificates, distinct from the certificate(s) used for HTTPS: one for encryption, one for signing.

For more information, please refer to: https://documentation.openiddict.com/configuration/encryption-and-signing-credentials.html#registering-a-certificate-recommended-for-production-ready-scenarios

> Also, see the [Configuring OpenIddict](https://docs.smartsoftware.io/en/ss/latest/Deployment/Configuring-OpenIddict#production-environment) documentation for more information.

#### Install Client-Side Libraries

Run the following command in the directory of your final application:

```bash
ss install-libs
```

> This command installs all NPM packages for MVC/Razor Pages and Blazor Server UIs and this command is already run by the SS CLI, so most of the time you don't need to run this command manually.

### How to Run

The application needs to connect to a database. Run the following command in the `MyCompanyName.MyProjectName` directory to migrate the database and seed the initial data:

````bash
dotnet run --migrate-database
````

This command will create and seed the initial database. Then you can run the application with any IDE that supports .NET.

### Deploying the application

Deploying an SS application is not different than deploying any .NET or ASP.NET Core application. However, there are some topics that you should care about when you are deploying your applications. You can check SS's [Deployment documentation](https://docs.smartsoftware.io/en/ss/latest/Deployment/Index) before deploying your application.
